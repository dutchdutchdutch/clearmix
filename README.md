## Overview

Clearmix is a web-based calculator that helps users accurately reconstitute peptide vials and calculate precise dosing. The tool guides users through the math of mixing bacteriostatic water with peptide powder and determining the correct syringe draw volume for their prescribed dose.

## Features (v0.1.0-pre)

### Two-Screen Mode
- **Mixing Screen**: Calculate how to reconstitute your peptide vial
- **Dosing Screen**: Calculate the exact draw volume for your dose

### Visual Syringe Meter
- Horizontal scale visualization showing exactly where to draw
- Dynamic tick marks that adjust based on syringe size (0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0 mL)
- Clear "draw to X units" guidance

### Smart Draw Calculations
- Automatically calculates multiple draws when volume exceeds syringe capacity
- Shows simple recommendations (e.g., "6 × 0.3 mL + 1 × 0.2 mL")

### User-Friendly Design
- Preset buttons for common values (5, 10, 15 mg vials; 1, 2, 3 mL water)
- Micrograms (mcg) for doses, milligrams (mg) for vials
- Inline examples for clarity
- Dark mode, medical-tech inspired UI

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python/Flask
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Custom CSS design system (no frameworks)
