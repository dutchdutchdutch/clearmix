# Build Report: v0.4.0 / Visual Polishing
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Build Status:** Ready for Review

## Executive Summary
This iteration focused on refining the visual communication in the "Add Bacteriostatic Water" step and streamlining the user flow. We successfully replaced text-heavy instructions with medically precise, visual syringe representations and consolidated the "Mix Gently" step to include final concentration details, removing redundant screens. The result is a cleaner, more intuitive, and visually aligned interface.

## Story Status
### Story: Visual Syringe Instructions
**Status:** Completed
-   Implemented dynamic visual syringe calculator.
-   Refined visuals to "Clean Ruler" style (removed overlay lines, added precise scale).
-   Consolidated Step 4 and Result Card.

## Technical Implementation
### Visual Syringe Renderer (`calculator.js` & `styles.css`)
-   **Grid Layout:** Migrated to CSS Grid for precise alignment of multipliers, syringes, and the ruler scale.
-   **Ruler Axis:** Implemented a pure CSS/JS generated ruler with major (10s) and minor (5s) ticks for medical precision.
-   **Dynamic Scaling:** Scale automatically adjusts (0-30, 0-50, 0-100) based on syringe selected.

### Step Consolidation
-   **HTML Structure:** Merged the "Result Card" into the "Mix Gently" Step 4 card.
-   **Dynamic Text:** Redirected concentration calculations to specific span elements within Step 4.
