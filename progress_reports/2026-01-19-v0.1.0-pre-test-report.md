## Manual Testing Performed

The following features were manually tested via browser subagent during development:

### Mixing Screen
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Vial presets (5, 10, 15 mg) | ✅ Verified | Selection updates state correctly |
| Custom vial input | ✅ Verified | "Other" reveals input field |
| Water presets (1, 2, 3 mL) | ✅ Verified | Selection updates state correctly |
| Syringe presets (0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0 mL) | ✅ Verified | All options functional |
| Water meter visualization | ✅ Verified | Scale and fill update correctly |
| Multi-draw calculation | ✅ Verified | Correctly shows "6 × 0.3 mL + 1 × 0.2 mL" |
| Concentration display | ✅ Verified | Shows mcg/mL and mg/mL |
| "Continue to Dosing" button | ✅ Verified | Navigates to dosing screen |

### Dosing Screen
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Mixed vial summary | ✅ Verified | Shows carried-over values |
| Dose input (mcg) | ✅ Verified | Updates results dynamically |
| Dosing syringe presets | ✅ Verified | 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 mL options work |
| Draw result (mL and units) | ✅ Verified | Correct calculation |
| Syringe meter visualization | ✅ Verified | Shows fill at correct position |
| Doses per vial | ✅ Verified | Correct calculation |
| "Back to Mixing" button | ✅ Verified | Navigates back correctly |

### Mode Navigation

| Mixing tab active by default | ✅ Verified | Correct initial state |
| Visual distinction (glow, border) | ✅ Verified | Active state is prominent |
| Tab switching | ✅ Verified | Both directions work |
| State persistence | ✅ Verified | Values maintained across switches |

## Tests Not Yet Automated

The following areas would benefit from automated testing in future releases:

1. **JavaScript calculation logic** - Unit tests for `calculateDosing()`, `calculateDrawsNeeded()`
2. **UI state changes** - E2E tests for preset button interactions
3. **Edge cases** - Invalid inputs, boundary values
4. **Responsive behavior** - Mobile viewport testing

## Test Environment

- **Python:** 3.12.12
- **pytest:** 9.0.2
- **Browser:** Chromium (via subagent)
- **OS:** macOS

## Conclusion

All automated tests pass. Manual testing confirms core functionality works as expected. The application is ready for external user testing.
