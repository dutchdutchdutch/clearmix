When I write RELEASE_PRE: <version> (<major|minor|patch|build>), treat the build as complete and switch to “reporting mode.”

- update the GitHub readme.md
- open reporting.md to create a status report
- open testreport.md and create a test report
Do not commit, tag, or push, Stop after changes are written
